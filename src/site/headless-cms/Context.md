## By prioritizing in this order :
- People - People are more important, so the user experience is paramount.
- Process - Processes are more important data. Business needs are greater than which database you use.
- Information - Information is more important than the platform. Platforms come and go, but information can transform and go anywhere.
- Platforms - Platforms serve the needs of information, which serve the needs of processes, which serve the need of people.

Technology serves business needs. Not the other way around. If you help the user achieve their goals, the platform is good.
